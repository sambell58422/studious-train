  <p>What is the software development process?

The Software Design process is a five step process used to break down the creation of a software program. The first step
is called the gathering requirements step, and is a crucial part of any software program. Gathering requirements consists 
of asking questions and communicating with clients to figure out all of the constraints for the program. The second step is the 
design step, this is when the requirements are taken and used to create an initial plan. Then the plan is turned into pseudocode.
The third step is the implementation step, which is where the pseudocode is used to create the first version of the program. 
After that, comes testing which is where the initial program is taken and put through rigorous testing in the attempt to find 
errors in the program. The fifth and final step is the maintenance step, this is where the errors are fixed and the program is finalized.

  <p>Why is software design important?

Technology and software are the future, new programs are coming out constantly in an attempt to make our lives easier. 
However, many programs fail and never get off the ground. So what separates the successful programs from the rest? Its 
software design. The more time used designing and developing the program the better it is going to end up. Software design 
can help with the efficiency and effectiveness of a program and can also help with creating a more user friendly program. 
In the end software design creates better programs and therefore is important for the future.
</p>
  <p>Give an example of a software that you personally used that you think was designed well and explain why.

A program that I use frequently that is designed well is Steam. Steam is an application that allows users to buy and play video games. 
It is designed in a very user friendly way so that someone who downloads Steam won't have to watch youtube tutorials on how it works. 
However it is not only for beginners, if you are looking for a platform where you can get in depth statistics on games or buy and sell 
in game items Steam is still a great option. What makes Steams design so good is that fact that it offers an easy platform for beginners 
but also is complex enough so that long time gamers get exactly what they need.

  <p>The gathering requirements stage is the first stage in the software development process and is arguably one of 
    the most important to the success of a software. Gathering requirements is all about communication and asking the 
    right questions. To gather the requirements for the software, the developers have to ask the clients a lot of questions to 
    build an understanding of what the software is and what it is needed to do. Some example questions are, how many people will be 
    using the software? Or, what is the product going to do? Without the gathering requirements stage, developers would have no idea
    how to create the software. Without an idea of how to build the software, the rest of the software design process falls apart. 
    The more time spent gathering specific requirements, the more time you will save when it comes to the developing stage. In short 
    the software development process would not work without the gathering requirements stage and it is crucial to take your time with it 
    so you understand all the specifications of the product.</p>
  
  <p>As a gamer, I want to be able to save my non downloaded games in a library, so that I can have easy access to them later. </p>
  
  <p>As a game developer, I want a most popular games section, so that customers can see which games are the best. </p>
  
  <p> As a gamer, I want a section that is strictly for free games, so that I can see all the games that are free to play. </p>
  
  <p>As a trader, I want to have a tab where I can see all of someone's in-game items, so that I can quickly see who is worth trading with or whether 
    I am getting scammed. </p>
  
  <p>As a trader, I want a marketplace, so that I can sell all of my in game items to other players for money </p>
